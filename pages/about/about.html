        <p>I'm a self taught Photographer <br>
            based in the Chesire region <br>
            I love taking photos of a variety of things <br>
            mostly which includes wildlife. <br><br>
            However I also experiment in <br>
            Portraits, Travel, Pets, Automotive <br>
            and any little extra projects I might find myself interested in. </p>

        <p>Fun fact: I actually started on the other side of the camera <br>
        Growing up I wanted to be an actor, however in 2024 <br>
        I lost my love for acting. Which was then rediscovered in 2025. <br>
        This time behind the camera.</p>
